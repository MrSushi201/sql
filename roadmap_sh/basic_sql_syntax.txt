Basic SQL Syntax

SQL, or Structured Query Language, uses a specific set of commands to interact with a database. 
It includes the use of keyword-like statements to accomplish several tasks.
The tasks can be creating, deleting, or modifying tables, retrieving, inserting, or modifying data. 

The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database. 
The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set. 
Example:
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table1;

The INSERT statement is used to insert new rows of data in a table. 
Example:
    INSERT INTO table1 
    (column1, column2, ..., columnN)
    VALUES
    (value1, value2, ..., valueN);

The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table. 
Example:
    UPDATE table1
    SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
    WHERE condition;

The DELETE statement is used to remove records from a table. 
Example:
    DELETE FROM table1
    WHERE condition;

The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database.
Example:
    CREATE TABLE table1 (
        column1 DATATYPE CONSTRAINT,
        column2 DATATYPE CONSTRAINT,
        ...,
        columnN DATATYPE CONSTRAINT
    );

The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete/drop or modify columns in the existing table. 
It is also used to add and drop constraints on the existing table. 
Example:
    --# To add a column
    ALTER TABLE table1
    ADD column_name DATATYPE;

    --# To delete/drop a column
    ALTER TABLE table1
    DROP COLUMN column_name;

    --# To modify existing column
    ALTER TABLE table1
    MODIFY COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;

The DROP TABLE statement is used to drop an existing table in a database. 
Example:
    DROP TABLE table1;

Data Types in SQL

SQL data types define the type of data that can be stored in a database table's column.
Depending on the DBMS (Database Management System), the names of the data types can differ slightly. 
Below are the general types:
* INT:
    INT is used for whole numbers. 
* DECIMAL:
    DECIMAL is used for decimal and fractional numbers.
* CHAR:
    CHAR is used for fixed-length strings.
* VARCHAR:
    VARCHAR is used for variable-length strings.
* DATE:
    DATE is used for dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
* DATETIME:
    DATETIME is used for date and time values in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
* BINARY:
    BINARY is used for binary strings. 
* BOOLEAN:
    BOOLEAN is used for boolean values (TRUE or FALSE). 

Example:
CREATE TABLE table (
    Id INT,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Initial CHAR(1),
    Price DECIMAL(5, 2),
    BirthDate DATE,
    OrderDate DATETIME,
)

Operators in SQL

SQL operators are used to perform operations like comparisons and arithmetic calculations.
They are very crucial in forming queries. SQL operators are divided into the following types:
* Arithmetic operators - Used to perform mathematical operations:
    +, -, *, /, %
* Comparison operators - Used in the WHERE clause to compare one expression with another:
    =, !=/<>, >, <, >=, <=
* Logical operators - Used to combine the result set of two different component condition:
    AND, OR, NOT
* Bitwise operators - Used to perform bit-level operations on the inputs: 
    &, |, ^
Examples:
    SELECT product, price, (price * 0.18) as tax
    FROM product_table;

    SELECT name, age
    FROM student_table
    WHERE age > 18;

    SELECT *
    FROM employee_table
    WHERE salary > 50000
    AND age < 30;
