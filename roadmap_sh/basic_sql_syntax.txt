Basic SQL Syntax

SQL, or Structured Query Language, uses a specific set of commands to interact with a database. 
It includes the use of keyword-like statements to accomplish several tasks.
The tasks can be creating, deleting, or modifying tables, retrieving, inserting, or modifying data. 

The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database. 
The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set. 
Example:
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table1;

The INSERT statement is used to insert new rows of data in a table. 
Example:
    INSERT INTO table1 
    (column1, column2, ..., columnN)
    VALUES
    (value1, value2, ..., valueN);

The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table. 
Example:
    UPDATE table1
    SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
    WHERE condition;

The DELETE statement is used to remove records from a table. 
Example:
    DELETE FROM table1
    WHERE condition;

The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database.
Example:
    CREATE TABLE table1 (
        column1 DATATYPE CONSTRAINT,
        column2 DATATYPE CONSTRAINT,
        ...,
        columnN DATATYPE CONSTRAINT
    );

The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete/drop or modify columns in the existing table. 
It is also used to add and drop constraints on the existing table. 
Example:
    --# To add a column
    ALTER TABLE table1
    ADD column_name DATATYPE;

    --# To delete/drop a column
    ALTER TABLE table1
    DROP COLUMN column_name;

    --# To modify existing column
    ALTER TABLE table1
    MODIFY COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;

The DROP TABLE statement is used to drop an existing table in a database. 
Example:
    DROP TABLE table1;

Data Types in SQL

SQL data types define the type of data that can be stored in a database table's column.
Depending on the DBMS (Database Management System), the names of the data types can differ slightly. 
Below are the general types:
* INT:
    INT is used for whole numbers. 
* DECIMAL:
    DECIMAL is used for decimal and fractional numbers.
* CHAR:
    CHAR is used for fixed-length strings.
* VARCHAR:
    VARCHAR is used for variable-length strings.
* DATE:
    DATE is used for dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
* DATETIME:
    DATETIME is used for date and time values in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
* BINARY:
    BINARY is used for binary strings. 
* BOOLEAN:
    BOOLEAN is used for boolean values (TRUE or FALSE). 

Example:
CREATE TABLE table (
    Id INT,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Initial CHAR(1),
    Price DECIMAL(5, 2),
    BirthDate DATE,
    OrderDate DATETIME,
)
--------------------

Operators in SQL

SQL operators are used to perform operations like comparisons and arithmetic calculations.
They are very crucial in forming queries. SQL operators are divided into the following types:
* Arithmetic operators - Used to perform mathematical operations:
    +, -, *, /, %
* Comparison operators - Used in the WHERE clause to compare one expression with another:
    =, !=/<>, >, <, >=, <=
* Logical operators - Used to combine the result set of two different component condition:
    AND, OR, NOT
* Bitwise operators - Used to perform bit-level operations on the inputs: 
    &, |, ^
Examples:
    SELECT product, price, (price * 0.18) as tax
    FROM product_table;

    SELECT name, age
    FROM student_table
    WHERE age > 18;

    SELECT *
    FROM employee_table
    WHERE salary > 50000
    AND age < 30;

Statements in SQL
SELECT statement
    The SELECT statement is used in SQL to pick out specific data from a database.
    In other words, it is used to select from the database what you would like to display.
    Example:
        SELECT column(s)
        FROM table
        WHERE condition;
    You can filter using WHERE clause, where a condition is used to filter the result-set. 
    You can also sort the results using the ORDER BY keyword:
        SELECT *
        FROM table
        ORDER BY column1; --# By default, the output is in ascending order. You can add DESC keyword to reverse the sorting.

INSERT statement
    The INSERT statement in SQL is used to add new records of data to a table in the database. 
    THERE are three forms of the INSERT statements:
        1. INSERT INTO VALUES
        2. INSERT INTO SET
        3. INSERT INTO SELECT

    INSERT INTO VALUES - The basic syntax for INSERT INTO VALUES:
        INSERT INTO table_name
        (column1, column2, ..., columnN)
        VALUES 
        (value1, value2, ..., valueN);
    This form of the INSERT statement specifies both the column names and the values to be inserted. 
    
    INSERT INTO SELECT - The syntax is used to copy data from one table and insert it into another table.
        INSERT INTO table_name1
        (column1, column2, ..., columnN)
        SELECT column1, column2, ..., columnN
        FROM table_name2
        WHERE condition;

UPDATE statement
    The SQL UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing data in a database.
    This statement is very useful when you need to change the values assigned to specific fields in an existing row or set of rows. 
    The general syntaxfor the UPDATE statement:
        UPDATE table
        SET
        column1 = value1,
        column2 = value2,
        ...
        columnN = valueN
        WHERE condition;

DELETE statement
    The DELETE statement in SQL helps you remove existing records from a database.
    However, keep in mid, it is a destructive operation and may permanently erase data from your database.
    With the DELETE statement, you can perform:
        Delete All Rows
            DELETE FROM table;
        Delete Specific Rows
            DELETE FROM table
            WHERE condition;
