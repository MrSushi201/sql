Data Manipulation Language

Data Manipulation Language, or DML in short, is a subcategory of SQL.
The purpose of DML is to insert, retrieve, update and delete data from the database.
DML contains 4 commands which are:
1. INSERT INTO - This command is used to insert new records into a table.
    Example: INSERT INTO table_name
             (column1, column2, ..., columnN)
             VALUES
             (value1, value2, ..., valueN)
2. SELECT - This command is used to select data from a database. The returned data is stored in a result table, called the result-set. 
    Example: SELECT column1, column2, ..., columnN
             FROM table_name;
3. UPDATE - This command is used to modify the existing rows in a table. 
    Example: UPDATE table_name
             SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ..., columnN = valueN
             WHERE condition;
4. DELETE FROM - This command is used to delete existing records from a table. 
    Example: DELETE FROM table_name
             WHERE condition;

More about SELECT

The SELECT statement in SQL is majorly used for fetching data from the database.
It is one of the most essential elements of SQL. 
Syntax Examples:
    SELECT column1, column2, ..., columnN
    FROM table;

    SELECT *
    FROM table;

    # SELECT DISTINCT is used to return only distinct (different) values. 
    SELECT DISTINCT(column1), column2, ..., columnN
    FROM table;

    # SELECT WHERE is used to filter records based on a condition.
    SELECT column1, column2, ..., columnN
    FROM table
    WHERE condition;

    # SELECT ORDER BY is used for sorting the result-set in ascending or descending order.
    SELECT column1, column2, ..., columnN
    FROM table
    ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;
--------------------

The FROM clause

The FROM clause in SQL specifies the tables from which the retrieval should be made. 
The FROM clause can also be used to join tables as well. 
Syntax Examples:
    # Simple usage
    SELECT column1, ..., columnN
    FROM table;

    # FROM with multiple tables
    SELECT table1.column1, table2.column1
    FROM table1, table2
    WHERE table1.key_column = table2.key_column;

    # FROM with Aliases
    SELECT a.column1, b.column2
    FROM table_1 AS a, table_2 AS b
    WHERE a.key_column = b.key_column;
NOTE: FROM is not limited only to SELECT. It is applicable to UPDATE and DELETE operations as well. 
--------------------

The WHERE clause
SQL provided a WHERE clause that is used to filter the records. 
You should use the WHERE clause to filter the records and fetching only the necessary records.
Syntax Examples:
    # Synstax structure
    SELECT column1, ..., columnN
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
