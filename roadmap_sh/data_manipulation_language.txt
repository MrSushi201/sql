Data Manipulation Language

Data Manipulation Language, or DML in short, is a subcategory of SQL.
The purpose of DML is to insert, retrieve, update and delete data from the database.
DML contains 4 commands which are:
1. INSERT INTO - This command is used to insert new records into a table.
    Example: INSERT INTO table_name
             (column1, column2, ..., columnN)
             VALUES
             (value1, value2, ..., valueN)
2. SELECT - This command is used to select data from a database. The returned data is stored in a result table, called the result-set. 
    Example: SELECT column1, column2, ..., columnN
             FROM table_name;
3. UPDATE - This command is used to modify the existing rows in a table. 
    Example: UPDATE table_name
             SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ..., columnN = valueN
             WHERE condition;
4. DELETE FROM - This command is used to delete existing records from a table. 
    Example: DELETE FROM table_name
             WHERE condition;
